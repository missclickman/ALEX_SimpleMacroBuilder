This is the Mlle ALEX simple macro builder, aka MLLE-ALEX_KEYSTROKER , i wanted it simple to use it, and i hope it is good.
I'm sure it's optimizable a lot, its total opensource, dont be shy , lets custom + re-share it!

;===============================================================================

*ChangeLog  : _v0.1	
- First real release.
- Send click to a specific game/windows , but for this the specified window need to be in the foreground (MLLE-ALEX_KEYSTROKER will do it itself, dont worry)
- Send Keystroke to non-focused / background game ; lets automate boring actions while surfing in the net, watch videos....
- Self-explained macro builder, just mouse-hover something to know what it will do
;===============================================================================

*Special features for The Secret World game :
- This script detect if your game is TSW , witch is known for his instability. So the script offers you to watch if the game crash, 
them reload it for you - turn-on macro when back in game.
For this, the script need your LOG and PASSWORD (dont be shy they are not saved)
